adventures in wonderland               alice s adventures in wonderland  lewis carroll  the millennium fulcrum edition         chapter i  down the rabbit hole  alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank  and of having nothing to do  once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading  but it had no pictures or conversations in it   and what is the use of a book   thought alice  without pictures or conversations    so she was considering in her own mind  as well as she could  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid   whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies  when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her   there was nothing so very remarkable in that  nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself   oh dear  oh dear  i shall be late    when she thought it over afterwards  it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this  but at the time it all seemed quite natural   but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket  and looked at it  and then hurried on  alice started to her feet  for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket  or a watch to take out of it  and burning with curiosity  she ran across the field after it  and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge   in another moment down went alice after it  never once considering how in the world she was to get out again   the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way  and then dipped suddenly down  so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well   either the well was very deep  or she fell very slowly  for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next  first  she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to  but it was too dark to see anything  then she looked at the sides of the well  and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves  here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs  she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed  it was labelled  orange marmalade   but to her great disappointment it was empty  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody  so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it    well   thought alice to herself   after such a fall as this  i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs  how brave they ll all think me at home  why  i wouldn t say anything about it  even if i fell off the top of the house    which was very likely true    down  down  down  would the fall never come to an end   i wonder how many miles i ve fallen by this time   she said aloud   i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth  let me see  that would be four thousand miles down  i think     for  you see  alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom  and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge  as there was no one to listen to her  still it was good practice to say it over     yes  that s about the right distance  but then i wonder what latitude or longitude i ve got to    alice had no idea what latitude was  or longitude either  but thought they were nice grand words to say    presently she began again   i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth  how funny it ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward  the antipathies  i think     she was rather glad there was no one listening  this time  as it didn t sound at all the right word     but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is  you know  please  ma am  is this new zealand or australia    and she tried to curtsey as she spoke  fancy curtseying as you re falling through the air  do you think you could manage it    and what an ignorant little girl she ll think me for asking  no  it ll never do to ask  perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere    down  down  down  there was nothing else to do  so alice soon began talking again   dinah ll miss me very much to night  i should think    dinah was the cat    i hope they ll remember her saucer of milk at tea time  dinah my dear  i wish you were down here with me  there are no mice in the air  i m afraid  but you might catch a bat  and that s very like a mouse  you know  but do cats eat bats  i wonder   and here alice began to get rather sleepy  and went on saying to herself  in a dreamy sort of way   do cats eat bats  do cats eat bats   and sometimes   do bats eat cats   for  you see  as she couldn t answer either question  it didn t much matter which way she put it  she felt that she was dozing off  and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah  and saying to her very earnestly   now  dinah  tell me the truth  did you ever eat a bat   when suddenly  thump  thump  down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves  and the fall was over   alice was not a bit hurt  and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment  she looked up  but it was all dark overhead  before her was another long passage  and the white rabbit was still in sight  hurrying down it  there was not a moment to be lost  away went alice like the wind  and was just in time to hear it say  as it turned a corner   oh my ears and whiskers  how late it s getting   she was close behind it when she turned the corner  but the rabbit was no longer to be seen  she found herself in a long  low hall  which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof   there were doors all round the hall  but they were all locked  and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other  trying every door  she walked sadly down the middle  wondering how she was ever to get out again   suddenly she came upon a little three legged table  all made of solid glass  there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key  and alice s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall  but  alas  either the locks were too large  or the key was too small  but at any rate it would not open any of them  however  on the second time round  she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before  and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high  she tried the little golden key in the lock  and to her great delight it fitted   alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage  not much larger than a rat hole  she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw  how she longed to get out of that dark hall  and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains  but she could not even get her head through the doorway   and even if my head would go through   thought poor alice   it would be of very little use without my shoulders  oh  how i wish i could shut up like a telescope  i think i could  if i only knew how to begin   for  you see  so many out of the way things had happened lately  that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible   there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door  so she went back to the table  half hoping she might find another key on it  or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes  this time she found a little bottle on it    which certainly was not here before   said alice   and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label  with the words  drink me  beautifully printed on it in large letters   it was all very well to say  drink me   but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry   no  i ll look first   she said   and see whether it s marked  poison  or not   for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt  and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things  all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them  such as  that a red hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long  and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife  it usually bleeds  and she had never forgotten that  if you drink much from a bottle marked  poison   it is almost certain to disagree with you  sooner or later   however  this bottle was not marked  poison   so alice ventured to taste it  and finding it very nice   it had  in fact  a sort of mixed flavour of cherry tart  custard  pine apple  roast turkey  toffee  and hot buttered toast   she very soon finished it off                                                                                                          what a curious feeling   said alice   i must be shutting up like a telescope    and so it was indeed  she was now only ten inches high  and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden  first  however  she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further  she felt a little nervous about this   for it might end  you know   said alice to herself   in my going out altogether  like a candle  i wonder what i should be like then   and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out  for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing   after a while  finding that nothing more happened  she decided on going into the garden at once  but  alas for poor alice  when she got to the door  she found she had forgotten the little golden key  and when she went back to the table for it  she found she could not possibly reach it  she could see it quite plainly through the glass  and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table  but it was too slippery  and when she had tired herself out with trying  the poor little thing sat down and cried    come  there s no use in crying like that   said alice to herself  rather sharply   i advise you to leave off this minute   she generally gave herself very good advice   though she very seldom followed it   and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes  and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself  for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people   but it s no use now   thought poor alice   to pretend to be two people  why  there s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person    soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table  she opened it  and found in it a very small cake  on which the words  eat me  were beautifully marked in currants   well  i ll eat it   said alice   and if it makes me grow larger  i can reach the key  and if it makes me grow smaller  i can creep under the door  so either way i ll get into the garden  and i don t care which happens    she ate a little bit  and said anxiously to herself   which way  which way    holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing  and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size  to be sure  this generally happens when one eats cake  but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out of the way things to happen  that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way   so she set to work  and very soon finished off the cake                                                                                                            chapter ii  the pool of tears   curiouser and curiouser   cried alice  she was so much surprised  that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english    now i m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was  good bye  feet    for when she looked down at her feet  they seemed to be almost out of sight  they were getting so far off    oh  my poor little feet  i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now  dears  i m sure  i  shan t be able  i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you  you must manage the best way you can   but i must be kind to them   thought alice   or perhaps they won t walk the way i want to go  let me see  i ll give them a new pair of boots every christmas    and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it   they must go by the carrier   she thought   and how funny it ll seem  sending presents to one s own feet  and how odd the directions will look        alice s right foot  esq         hearthrug           near the fender              with alice s love    oh dear  what nonsense i m talking    just then her head struck against the roof of the hall  in fact she was now more than nine feet high  and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door   poor alice  it was as much as she could do  lying down on one side  to look through into the garden with one eye  but to get through was more hopeless than ever  she sat down and began to cry again    you ought to be ashamed of yourself   said alice   a great girl like you    she might well say this    to go on crying in this way  stop this moment  i tell you   but she went on all the same  shedding gallons of tears  until there was a large pool all round her  about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall   after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance  and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming  it was the white rabbit returning  splendidly dressed  with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other  he came trotting along in a great hurry  muttering to himself as he came   oh  the duchess  the duchess  oh  won t she be savage if i ve kept her waiting   alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one  so  when the rabbit came near her  she began  in a low  timid voice   if you please  sir    the rabbit started violently  dropped the white kid gloves and the fan  and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go   alice took up the fan and gloves  and  as the hall was very hot  she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking   dear  dear  how queer everything is to day  and yesterday things went on just as usual  i wonder if i ve been changed in the night  let me think  was i the same when i got up this morning  i almost think i can remember feeling a little different  but if i m not the same  the next question is  who in the world am i  ah  that s the great puzzle   and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself  to see if she could have been changed for any of them    i m sure i m not ada   she said   for her hair goes in such long ringlets  and mine doesn t go in ringlets at all  and i m sure i can t be mabel  for i know all sorts of things  and she  oh  she knows such a very little  besides  she s she  and i m i  and  oh dear  how puzzling it all is  i ll try if i know all the things i used to know  let me see  four times five is twelve  and four times six is thirteen  and four times seven is  oh dear  i shall never get to twenty at that rate  however  the multiplication table doesn t signify  let s try geography  london is the capital of paris  and paris is the capital of rome  and rome  no  that s all wrong  i m certain  i must have been changed for mabel  i ll try and say  how doth the little     and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons  and began to repeat it  but her voice sounded hoarse and strange  and the words did not come the same as they used to do           how doth the little crocodile       improve his shining tail       and pour the waters of the nile       on every golden scale         how cheerfully he seems to grin        how neatly spread his claws       and welcome little fishes in       with gently smiling jaws     i m sure those are not the right words   said poor alice  and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on   i must be mabel after all  and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house  and have next to no toys to play with  and oh  ever so many lessons to learn  no  i ve made up my mind about it  if i m mabel  i ll stay down here  it ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying  come up again  dear   i shall only look up and say  who am i then  tell me that first  and then  if i like being that person  i ll come up  if not  i ll stay down here till i m somebody else   but  oh dear   cried alice  with a sudden burst of tears   i do wish they would put their heads down  i am so very tired of being all alone here    as she said this she looked down at her hands  and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit s little white kid gloves while she was talking   how can i have done that   she thought   i must be growing small again   she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it  and found that  as nearly as she could guess  she was now about two feet high  and was going on shrinking rapidly  she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding  and she dropped it hastily  just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether    that was a narrow escape   said alice  a good deal frightened at the sudden change  but very glad to find herself still in existence   and now for the garden   and she ran with all speed back to the little door  but  alas  the little door was shut again  and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before   and things are worse than ever   thought the poor child   for i never was so small as this before  never  and i declare it s too bad  that it is    as she said these words her foot slipped  and in another moment  splash  she was up to her chin in salt water  her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea   and in that case i can go back by railway   she said to herself   alice had been to the seaside once in her life  and had come to the general conclusion  that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea  some children digging in the sand with wooden spades  then a row of lodging houses  and behind them a railway station   however  she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high    i wish i hadn t cried so much   said alice  as she swam about  trying to find her way out   i shall be punished for it now  i suppose  by being drowned in my own tears  that will be a queer thing  to be sure  however  everything is queer to day    just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off  and she swam nearer to make out what it was  at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus  but then she remembered how small she was now  and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself    would it be of any use  now   thought alice   to speak to this mouse  everything is so out of the way down here  that i should think very likely it can talk  at any rate  there s no harm in trying   so she began   o mouse  do you know the way out of this pool  i am very tired of swimming about here  o mouse    alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse  she had never done such a thing before  but she remembered having seen in her brother s latin grammar   a mouse  of a mouse  to a mouse  a mouse  o mouse    the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively  and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes  but it said nothing    perhaps it doesn t understand english   thought alice   i daresay it s a french mouse  come over with william the conqueror    for  with all her knowledge of history  alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened   so she began again   ou est ma chatte   which was the first sentence in her french lesson book  the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water  and seemed to quiver all over with fright   oh  i beg your pardon   cried alice hastily  afraid that she had hurt the poor animal s feelings   i quite forgot you didn t like cats     not like cats   cried the mouse  in a shrill  passionate voice   would you like cats if you were me     well  perhaps not   said alice in a soothing tone   don t be angry about it  and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah  i think you d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her  she is such a dear quiet thing   alice went on  half to herself  as she swam lazily about in the pool   and she sits purring so nicely by the fire  licking her paws and washing her face  and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse  and she s such a capital one for catching mice  oh  i beg your pardon   cried alice again  for this time the mouse was bristling all over  and she felt certain it must be really offended   we won t talk about her any more if you d rather not     we indeed   cried the mouse  who was trembling down to the end of his tail   as if i would talk on such a subject  our family always hated cats  nasty  low  vulgar things  don t let me hear the name again     i won t indeed   said alice  in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation   are you  are you fond  of  of dogs   the mouse did not answer  so alice went on eagerly   there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you  a little bright eyed terrier  you know  with oh  such long curly brown hair  and it ll fetch things when you throw them  and it ll sit up and beg for its dinner  and all sorts of things  i can t remember half of them  and it belongs to a farmer  you know  and he says it s so useful  it s worth a hundred pounds  he says it kills all the rats and  oh dear   cried alice in a sorrowful tone   i m afraid i ve offended it again   for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go  and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went   so she called softly after it   mouse dear  do come back again  and we won t talk about cats or dogs either  if you don t like them   when the mouse heard this  it turned round and swam slowly back to her  its face was quite pale  with passion  alice thought   and it said in a low trembling voice   let us get to the shore  and then i ll tell you my history  and you ll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs    it was high time to go  for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it  there were a duck and a dodo  a lory and an eaglet  and several other curious creatures  alice led the way  and the whole party swam to the shore      chapter iii  a caucus race and a long tale  they were indeed a queer looking party that assembled on the bank  the birds with draggled feathers  the animals with their fur clinging close to them  and all dripping wet  cross  and uncomfortable   the first question of course was  how to get dry again  they had a consultation about this  and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them  as if she had known them all her life  indeed  she had quite a long argument with the lory  who at last turned sulky  and would only say   i am older than you  and must know better   and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was  and  as the lory positively refused to tell its age  there was no more to be said   at last the mouse  who seemed to be a person of authority among them  called out   sit down  all of you  and listen to me  i ll soon make you dry enough   they all sat down at once  in a large ring  with the mouse in the middle  alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it  for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon    ahem   said the mouse with an important air   are you all ready  this is the driest thing i know  silence all round  if you please   william the conqueror  whose cause was favoured by the pope  was soon submitted to by the english  who wanted leaders  and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest  edwin and morcar  the earls of mercia and northumbria       ugh   said the lory  with a shiver    i beg your pardon   said the mouse  frowning  but very politely   did you speak     not i   said the lory hastily    i thought you did   said the mouse     i proceed   edwin and morcar  the earls of mercia and northumbria  declared for him  and even stigand  the patriotic archbishop of canterbury  found it advisable       found what   said the duck    found it   the mouse replied rather crossly   of course you know what  it  means     i know what  it  means well enough  when i find a thing   said the duck   it s generally a frog or a worm  the question is  what did the archbishop find    the mouse did not notice this question  but hurriedly went on      found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown  william s conduct at first was moderate  but the insolence of his normans    how are you getting on now  my dear   it continued  turning to alice as it spoke    as wet as ever   said alice in a melancholy tone   it doesn t seem to dry me at all     in that case   said the dodo solemnly  rising to its feet   i move that the meeting adjourn  for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies      speak english   said the eaglet   i don t know the meaning of half those long words  and  what s more  i don t believe you do either   and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile  some of the other birds tittered audibly    what i was going to say   said the dodo in an offended tone   was  that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus race     what is a caucus race   said alice  not that she wanted much to know  but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak  and no one else seemed inclined to say anything    why   said the dodo   the best way to explain it is to do it    and  as you might like to try the thing yourself  some winter day  i will tell you how the dodo managed it    first it marked out a race course  in a sort of circle    the exact shape doesn t matter   it said   and then all the party were placed along the course  here and there  there was no  one  two  three  and away   but they began running when they liked  and left off when they liked  so that it was not easy to know when the race was over  however  when they had been running half an hour or so  and were quite dry again  the dodo suddenly called out  the race is over   and they all crowded round it  panting  and asking   but who has won    this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought  and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead  the position in which you usually see shakespeare  in the pictures of him   while the rest waited in silence  at last the dodo said   everybody has won  and all must have prizes     but who is to give the prizes   quite a chorus of voices asked    why  she  of course   said the dodo  pointing to alice with one finger  and the whole party at once crowded round her  calling out in a confused way   prizes  prizes    alice had no idea what to do  and in despair she put her hand in her pocket  and pulled out a box of comfits   luckily the salt water had not got into it   and handed them round as prizes  there was exactly one a piece all round    but she must have a prize herself  you know   said the mouse    of course   the dodo replied very gravely   what else have you got in your pocket   he went on  turning to alice    only a thimble   said alice sadly    hand it over here   said the dodo   then they all crowded round her once more  while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble  saying  we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble   and  when it had finished this short speech  they all cheered   alice thought the whole thing very absurd  but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh  and  as she could not think of anything to say  she simply bowed  and took the thimble  looking as solemn as she could   the next thing was to eat the comfits  this caused some noise and confusion  as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs  and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back  however  it was over at last  and they sat down again in a ring  and begged the mouse to tell them something more    you promised to tell me your history  you know   said alice   and why it is you hate  c and d   she added in a whisper  half afraid that it would be offended again    mine is a long and a sad tale   said the mouse  turning to alice  and sighing    it is a long tail  certainly   said alice  looking down with wonder at the mouse s tail   but why do you call it sad   and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking  so that her idea of the tale was something like this               fury said to a          mouse  that he         met in the        house        let us       both go to        law  i will         prosecute          you   come             i ll take no            denial  we           must have a         trial  for       really this      morning i ve     nothing     to do         said the       mouse to the        cur   such         a trial           dear sir              with           no jury         or judge         would be       wasting       our       breath            i ll be         judge  i ll          be jury                said          cunning           old fury             i ll           try the             whole             cause                and            condemn            you           to            death       you are not attending   said the mouse to alice severely   what are you thinking of     i beg your pardon   said alice very humbly   you had got to the fifth bend  i think     i had not   cried the mouse  sharply and very angrily    a knot   said alice  always ready to make herself useful  and looking anxiously about her   oh  do let me help to undo it     i shall do nothing of the sort   said the mouse  getting up and walking away   you insult me by talking such nonsense     i didn t mean it   pleaded poor alice   but you re so easily offended  you know    the mouse only growled in reply    please come back and finish your story   alice called after it  and the others all joined in chorus   yes  please do   but the mouse only shook its head impatiently  and walked a little quicker    what a pity it wouldn t stay   sighed the lory  as soon as it was quite out of sight  and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter  ah  my dear  let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper    hold your tongue  ma   said the young crab  a little snappishly   you re enough to try the patience of an oyster     i wish i had our dinah here  i know i do   said alice aloud  addressing nobody in particular   she d soon fetch it back     and who is dinah  if i might venture to ask the question   said the lory   alice replied eagerly  for she was always ready to talk about her pet   dinah s our cat  and she s such a capital one for catching mice you can t think  and oh  i wish you could see her after the birds  why  she ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it    this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party  some of the birds hurried off at once  one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully  remarking   i really must be getting home  the night air doesn t suit my throat   and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children   come away  my dears  it s high time you were all in bed   on various pretexts they all moved off  and alice was soon left alone    i wish i hadn t mentioned dinah   she said to herself in a melancholy tone   nobody seems to like her  down here  and i m sure she s the best cat in the world  oh  my dear dinah  i wonder if i shall ever see you any more   and here poor alice began to cry again  for she felt very lonely and low spirited  in a little while  however  she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance  and she looked up eagerly  half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind  and was coming back to finish his story      chapter iv  the rabbit sends in a little bill  it was the white rabbit  trotting slowly back again  and looking anxiously about as it went  as if it had lost something  and she heard it muttering to itself  the duchess  the duchess  oh my dear paws  oh my fur and whiskers  she ll get me executed  as sure as ferrets are ferrets  where can i have dropped them  i wonder   alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves  and she very good naturedly began hunting about for them  but they were nowhere to be seen  everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool  and the great hall  with the glass table and the little door  had vanished completely   very soon the rabbit noticed alice  as she went hunting about  and called out to her in an angry tone   why  mary ann  what are you doing out here  run home this moment  and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan  quick  now   and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to  without trying to explain the mistake it had made    he took me for his housemaid   she said to herself as she ran   how surprised he ll be when he finds out who i am  but i d better take him his fan and gloves  that is  if i can find them   as she said this  she came upon a neat little house  on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name  w  rabbit  engraved upon it  she went in without knocking  and hurried upstairs  in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann  and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves    how queer it seems   alice said to herself   to be going messages for a rabbit  i suppose dinah ll be sending me on messages next   and she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen    miss alice  come here directly  and get ready for your walk    coming in a minute  nurse  but i ve got to see that the mouse doesn t get out   only i don t think   alice went on   that they d let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that    by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window  and on it  as she had hoped  a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves  she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves  and was just going to leave the room  when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking glass  there was no label this time with the words  drink me   but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips   i know something interesting is sure to happen   she said to herself   whenever i eat or drink anything  so i ll just see what this bottle does  i do hope it ll make me grow large again  for really i m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing    it did so indeed  and much sooner than she had expected  before she had drunk half the bottle  she found her head pressing against the ceiling  and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken  she hastily put down the bottle  saying to herself  that s quite enough  i hope i shan t grow any more  as it is  i can t get out at the door  i do wish i hadn t drunk quite so much    alas  it was too late to wish that  she went on growing  and growing  and very soon had to kneel down on the floor  in another minute there was not even room for this  and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door  and the other arm curled round her head  still she went on growing  and  as a last resource  she put one arm out of the window  and one foot up the chimney  and said to herself  now i can do no more  whatever happens  what will become of me    luckily for alice  the little magic bottle had now had its full effect  and she grew no larger  still it was very uncomfortable  and  as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again  no wonder she felt unhappy    it was much pleasanter at home   thought poor alice   when one wasn t always growing larger and smaller  and being ordered about by mice and rabbits  i almost wish i hadn t gone down that rabbit hole  and yet  and yet  it s rather curious  you know  this sort of life  i do wonder what can have happened to me  when i used to read fairy tales  i fancied that kind of thing never happened  and now here i am in the middle of one  there ought to be a book written about me  that there ought  and when i grow up  i ll write one  but i m grown up now   she added in a sorrowful tone   at least there s no room to grow up any more here     but then   thought alice   shall i never get any older than i am now  that ll be a comfort  one way  never to be an old woman  but then  always to have lessons to learn  oh  i shouldn t like that     oh  you foolish alice   she answered herself   how can you learn lessons in here  why  there s hardly room for you  and no room at all for any lesson books    and so she went on  taking first one side and then the other  and making quite a conversation of it altogether  but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside  and stopped to listen    mary ann  mary ann   said the voice   fetch me my gloves this moment   then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs  alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her  and she trembled till she shook the house  quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit  and had no reason to be afraid of it   presently the rabbit came up to the door  and tried to open it  but  as the door opened inwards  and alice s elbow was pressed hard against it  that attempt proved a failure  alice heard it say to itself  then i ll go round and get in at the window     that you won t  thought alice  and  after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window  she suddenly spread out her hand  and made a snatch in the air  she did not get hold of anything  but she heard a little shriek and a fall  and a crash of broken glass  from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber frame  or something of the sort   next came an angry voice  the rabbit s   pat  pat  where are you   and then a voice she had never heard before   sure then i m here  digging for apples  yer honour     digging for apples  indeed   said the rabbit angrily   here  come and help me out of this    sounds of more broken glass     now tell me  pat  what s that in the window     sure  it s an arm  yer honour    he pronounced it  arrum      an arm  you goose  who ever saw one that size  why  it fills the whole window     sure  it does  yer honour  but it s an arm for all that     well  it s got no business there  at any rate  go and take it away    there was a long silence after this  and alice could only hear whispers now and then  such as   sure  i don t like it  yer honour  at all  at all    do as i tell you  you coward   and at last she spread out her hand again  and made another snatch in the air  this time there were two little shrieks  and more sounds of broken glass   what a number of cucumber frames there must be   thought alice   i wonder what they ll do next  as for pulling me out of the window  i only wish they could  i m sure i don t want to stay in here any longer    she waited for some time without hearing anything more  at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels  and the sound of a good many voices all talking together  she made out the words   where s the other ladder   why  i hadn t to bring but one  bill s got the other  bill  fetch it here  lad   here  put  em up at this corner  no  tie  em together first  they don t reach half high enough yet  oh  they ll do well enough  don t be particular  here  bill  catch hold of this rope  will the roof bear   mind that loose slate  oh  it s coming down  heads below    a loud crash    now  who did that   it was bill  i fancy  who s to go down the chimney   nay  i shan t  you do it   that i won t  then   bill s to go down  here  bill  the master says you re to go down the chimney     oh  so bill s got to come down the chimney  has he   said alice to herself   shy  they seem to put everything upon bill  i wouldn t be in bill s place for a good deal  this fireplace is narrow  to be sure  but i think i can kick a little    she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could  and waited till she heard a little animal  she couldn t guess of what sort it was  scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her  then  saying to herself  this is bill   she gave one sharp kick  and waited to see what would happen next   the first thing she heard was a general chorus of  there goes bill   then the rabbit s voice along   catch him  you by the hedge   then silence  and then another confusion of voices   hold up his head  brandy now  don t choke him  how was it  old fellow  what happened to you  tell us all about it    last came a little feeble  squeaking voice    that s bill   thought alice    well  i hardly know  no more  thank ye  i m better now  but i m a deal too flustered to tell you  all i know is  something comes at me like a jack in the box  and up i goes like a sky rocket     so you did  old fellow   said the others    we must burn the house down   said the rabbit s voice  and alice called out as loud as she could   if you do  i ll set dinah at you    there was a dead silence instantly  and alice thought to herself   i wonder what they will do next  if they had any sense  they d take the roof off   after a minute or two  they began moving about again  and alice heard the rabbit say   a barrowful will do  to begin with     a barrowful of what   thought alice  but she had not long to doubt  for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window  and some of them hit her in the face   i ll put a stop to this   she said to herself  and shouted out   you d better not do that again   which produced another dead silence   alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor  and a bright idea came into her head   if i eat one of these cakes   she thought   it s sure to make some change in my size  and as it can t possibly make me larger  it must make me smaller  i suppose    so she swallowed one of the cakes  and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly  as soon as she was small enough to get through the door  she ran out of the house  and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside  the poor little lizard  bill  was in the middle  being held up by two guinea pigs  who were giving it something out of a bottle  they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared  but she ran off as hard as she could  and soon found herself safe in a thick wood    the first thing i ve got to do   said alice to herself  as she wandered about in the wood   is to grow to my right size again  and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden  i think that will be the best plan    it sounded an excellent plan  no doubt  and very neatly and simply arranged  the only difficulty was  that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it  and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees  a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry   an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes  and feebly stretching out one paw  trying to touch her   poor little thing   said alice  in a coaxing tone  and she tried hard to whistle to it  but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry  in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing   hardly knowing what she did  she picked up a little bit of stick  and held it out to the puppy  whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once  with a yelp of delight  and rushed at the stick  and made believe to worry it  then alice dodged behind a great thistle  to keep herself from being run over  and the moment she appeared on the other side  the puppy made another rush at the stick  and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it  then alice  thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart horse  and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet  ran round the thistle again  then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick  running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back  and barking hoarsely all the while  till at last it sat down a good way off  panting  with its tongue hanging out of its mouth  and its great eyes half shut   this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape  so she set off at once  and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath  and till the puppy s bark sounded quite faint in the distance    and yet what a dear little puppy it was   said alice  as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself  and fanned herself with one of the leaves   i should have liked teaching it tricks very much  if  if i d only been the right size to do it  oh dear  i d nearly forgotten that i ve got to grow up again  let me see  how is it to be managed  i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other  but the great question is  what    the great question certainly was  what  alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass  but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances  there was a large mushroom growing near her  about the same height as herself  and when she had looked under it  and on both sides of it  and behind it  it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it   she stretched herself up on tiptoe  and peeped over the edge of the mushroom  and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar  that was sitting on the top with its arms folded  quietly smoking a long hookah  and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else      chapter v  advice from a caterpillar  the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence  at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth  and addressed her in a languid  sleepy voice    who are you   said the caterpillar   this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation  alice replied  rather shyly   i  i hardly know  sir  just at present  at least i know who i was when i got up this morning  but i think i must have been changed several times since then     what do you mean by that   said the caterpillar sternly   explain yourself     i can t explain myself  i m afraid  sir  said alice   because i m not myself  you see     i don t see   said the caterpillar    i m afraid i can t put it more clearly   alice replied very politely   for i can t understand it myself to begin with  and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing     it isn t   said the caterpillar    well  perhaps you haven t found it so yet   said alice   but when you have to turn into a chrysalis  you will some day  you know  and then after that into a butterfly  i should think you ll feel it a little queer  won t you     not a bit   said the caterpillar    well  perhaps your feelings may be different   said alice   all i know is  it would feel very queer to me     you   said the caterpillar contemptuously   who are you    which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation  alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar s making such very short remarks  and she drew herself up and said  very gravely   i think  you ought to tell me who you are  first     why   said the caterpillar   here was another puzzling question  and as alice could not think of any good reason  and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind  she turned away    come back   the caterpillar called after her   i ve something important to say    this sounded promising  certainly  alice turned and came back again    keep your temper   said the caterpillar    is that all   said alice  swallowing down her anger as well as she could    no   said the caterpillar   alice thought she might as well wait  as she had nothing else to do  and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing  for some minutes it puffed away without speaking  but at last it unfolded its arms  took the hookah out of its mouth again  and said   so you think you re changed  do you     i m afraid i am  sir   said alice   i can t remember things as i used  and i don t keep the same size for ten minutes together     can t remember what things   said the caterpillar    well  i ve tried to say  how doth the little busy bee   but it all came different   alice replied in a very melancholy voice    repeat   you are old  father william    said the caterpillar   alice folded her hands  and began         you are old  father william   the young man said       and your hair has become very white     and yet you incessantly stand on your head       do you think  at your age  it is right        in my youth   father william replied to his son       i feared it might injure the brain     but  now that i m perfectly sure i have none      why  i do it again and again        you are old   said the youth   as i mentioned before      and have grown most uncommonly fat     yet you turned a back somersault in at the door       pray  what is the reason of that        in my youth   said the sage  as he shook his grey locks       i kept all my limbs very supple    by the use of this ointment  one shilling the box       allow me to sell you a couple        you are old   said the youth   and your jaws are too weak     for anything tougher than suet     yet you finished the goose  with the bones and the beak       pray how did you manage to do it        in my youth   said his father   i took to the law      and argued each case with my wife     and the muscular strength  which it gave to my jaw      has lasted the rest of my life        you are old   said the youth   one would hardly suppose     that your eye was as steady as ever     yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose       what made you so awfully clever        i have answered three questions  and that is enough       said his father   don t give yourself airs     do you think i can listen all day to such stuff      be off  or i ll kick you down stairs      that is not said right   said the caterpillar    not quite right  i m afraid   said alice  timidly   some of the words have got altered     it is wrong from beginning to end   said the caterpillar decidedly  and there was silence for some minutes   the caterpillar was the first to speak    what size do you want to be   it asked    oh  i m not particular as to size   alice hastily replied   only one doesn t like changing so often  you know     i don t know   said the caterpillar   alice said nothing  she had never been so much contradicted in her life before  and she felt that she was losing her temper    are you content now   said the caterpillar    well  i should like to be a little larger  sir  if you wouldn t mind   said alice   three inches is such a wretched height to be     it is a very good height indeed   said the caterpillar angrily  rearing itself upright as it spoke  it was exactly three inches high     but i m not used to it   pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone  and she thought of herself   i wish the creatures wouldn t be so easily offended     you ll get used to it in time   said the caterpillar  and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again   this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again  in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice  and shook itself  then it got down off the mushroom  and crawled away in the grass  merely remarking as it went   one side will make you grow taller  and the other side will make you grow shorter     one side of what  the other side of what   thought alice to herself    of the mushroom   said the caterpillar  just as if she had asked it aloud  and in another moment it was out of sight   alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute  trying to make out which were the two sides of it  and as it was perfectly round  she found this a very difficult question  however  at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go  and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand    and now which is which   she said to herself  and nibbled a little of the right hand bit to try the effect  the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin  it had struck her foot   she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change  but she felt that there was no time to be lost  as she was shrinking rapidly  so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit  her chin was pressed so closely against her foot  that there was hardly room to open her mouth  but she did it at last  and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit                                                                                                           come  my head s free at last   said alice in a tone of delight  which changed into alarm in another moment  when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found  all she could see  when she looked down  was an immense length of neck  which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her    what can all that green stuff be   said alice   and where have my shoulders got to  and oh  my poor hands  how is it i can t see you   she was moving them about as she spoke  but no result seemed to follow  except a little shaking among the distant green leaves   as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head  she tried to get her head down to them  and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction  like a serpent  she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag  and was going to dive in among the leaves  which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering  when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry  a large pigeon had flown into her face  and was beating her violently with its wings    serpent   screamed the pigeon    i m not a serpent   said alice indignantly   let me alone     serpent  i say again   repeated the pigeon  but in a more subdued tone  and added with a kind of sob   i ve tried every way  and nothing seems to suit them     i haven t the least idea what you re talking about   said alice    i ve tried the roots of trees  and i ve tried banks  and i ve tried hedges   the pigeon went on  without attending to her   but those serpents  there s no pleasing them    alice was more and more puzzled  but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished    as if it wasn t trouble enough hatching the eggs   said the pigeon   but i must be on the look out for serpents night and day  why  i haven t had a wink of sleep these three weeks     i m very sorry you ve been annoyed   said alice  who was beginning to see its meaning    and just as i d taken the highest tree in the wood   continued the pigeon  raising its voice to a shriek   and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last  they must needs come wriggling down from the sky  ugh  serpent     but i m not a serpent  i tell you   said alice   i m a  i m a      well  what are you   said the pigeon   i can see you re trying to invent something     i  i m a little girl   said alice  rather doubtfully  as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day    a likely story indeed   said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt   i ve seen a good many little girls in my time  but never one with such a neck as that  no  no  you re a serpent  and there s no use denying it  i suppose you ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg     i have tasted eggs  certainly   said alice  who was a very truthful child   but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do  you know     i don t believe it   said the pigeon   but if they do  why then they re a kind of serpent  that s all i can say    this was such a new idea to alice  that she was quite silent for a minute or two  which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding   you re looking for eggs  i know that well enough  and what does it matter to me whether you re a little girl or a serpent     it matters a good deal to me   said alice hastily   but i m not looking for eggs  as it happens  and if i was  i shouldn t want yours  i don t like them raw     well  be off  then   said the pigeon in a sulky tone  as it settled down again into its nest  alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could  for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches  and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it  after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands  and she set to work very carefully  nibbling first at one and then at the other  and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter  until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height   it was so long since she had been anything near the right size  that it felt quite strange at first  but she got used to it in a few minutes  and began talking to herself  as usual   come  there s half my plan done now  how puzzling all these changes are  i m never sure what i m going to be  from one minute to another  however  i ve got back to my right size  the next thing is  to get into that beautiful garden  how is that to be done  i wonder   as she said this  she came suddenly upon an open place  with a little house in it about four feet high   whoever lives there   thought alice   it ll never do to come upon them this size  why  i should frighten them out of their wits   so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again  and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high      chapter vi  pig and pepper  for a minute or two she stood looking at the house  and wondering what to do next  when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood   she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery  otherwise  judging by his face only  she would have called him a fish   and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles  it was opened by another footman in livery  with a round face  and large eyes like a frog  and both footmen  alice noticed  had powdered hair that curled all over their heads  she felt very curious to know what it was all about  and crept a little way out of the wood to listen   the fish footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter  nearly as large as himself  and this he handed over to the other  saying  in a solemn tone   for the duchess  an invitation from the queen to play croquet   the frog footman repeated  in the same solemn tone  only changing the order of the words a little   from the queen  an invitation for the duchess to play croquet    then they both bowed low  and their curls got entangled together   alice laughed so much at this  that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her  and when she next peeped out the fish footman was gone  and the other was sitting on the ground near the door  staring stupidly up into the sky   alice went timidly up to the door  and knocked    there s no sort of use in knocking   said the footman   and that for two reasons  first  because i m on the same side of the door as you are  secondly  because they re making such a noise inside  no one could possibly hear you   and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within  a constant howling and sneezing  and every now and then a great crash  as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces    please  then   said alice   how am i to get in     there might be some sense in your knocking   the footman went on without attending to her   if we had the door between us  for instance  if you were inside  you might knock  and i could let you out  you know   he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking  and this alice thought decidedly uncivil   but perhaps he can t help it   she said to herself   his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head  but at any rate he might answer questions   how am i to get in   she repeated  aloud    i shall sit here   the footman remarked   till tomorrow     at this moment the door of the house opened  and a large plate came skimming out  straight at the footman s head  it just grazed his nose  and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him      or next day  maybe   the footman continued in the same tone  exactly as if nothing had happened    how am i to get in   asked alice again  in a louder tone    are you to get in at all   said the footman   that s the first question  you know    it was  no doubt  only alice did not like to be told so   it s really dreadful   she muttered to herself   the way all the creatures argue  it s enough to drive one crazy    the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark  with variations   i shall sit here   he said   on and off  for days and days     but what am i to do   said alice    anything you like   said the footman  and began whistling    oh  there s no use in talking to him   said alice desperately   he s perfectly idiotic   and she opened the door and went in   the door led right into a large kitchen  which was full of smoke from one end to the other  the duchess was sitting on a three legged stool in the middle  nursing a baby  the cook was leaning over the fire  stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup    there s certainly too much pepper in that soup   alice said to herself  as well as she could for sneezing   there was certainly too much of it in the air  even the duchess sneezed occasionally  and as for the baby  it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment s pause  the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze  were the cook  and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear    please would you tell me   said alice  a little timidly  for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first   why your cat grins like that     it s a cheshire cat   said the duchess   and that s why  pig    she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite jumped  but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby  and not to her  so she took courage  and went on again      i didn t know that cheshire cats always grinned  in fact  i didn t know that cats could grin     they all can   said the duchess   and most of  em do     i don t know of any that do   alice said very politely  feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation    you don t know much   said the duchess   and that s a fact    alice did not at all like the tone of this remark  and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation  while she was trying to fix on one  the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire  and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby  the fire irons came first  then followed a shower of saucepans  plates  and dishes  the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her  and the baby was howling so much already  that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not    oh  please mind what you re doing   cried alice  jumping up and down in an agony of terror   oh  there goes his precious nose   as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it  and very nearly carried it off    if everybody minded their own business   the duchess said in a hoarse growl   the world would go round a deal faster than it does     which would not be an advantage   said alice  who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge   just think of what work it would make with the day and night  you see the earth takes twenty four hours to turn round on its axis      talking of axes   said the duchess   chop off her head    alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook  to see if she meant to take the hint  but the cook was busily stirring the soup  and seemed not to be listening  so she went on again   twenty four hours  i think  or is it twelve  i      oh  don t bother me   said the duchess   i never could abide figures   and with that she began nursing her child again  singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so  and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line       speak roughly to your little boy      and beat him when he sneezes     he only does it to annoy      because he knows it teases             chorus     in which the cook and the baby joined              wow  wow  wow    while the duchess sang the second verse of the song  she kept tossing the baby violently up and down  and the poor little thing howled so  that alice could hardly hear the words         i speak severely to my boy      i beat him when he sneezes     for he can thoroughly enjoy     the pepper when he pleases             chorus           wow  wow  wow     here  you may nurse it a bit  if you like   the duchess said to alice  flinging the baby at her as she spoke   i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen   and she hurried out of the room  the cook threw a frying pan after her as she went out  but it just missed her   alice caught the baby with some difficulty  as it was a queer shaped little creature  and held out its arms and legs in all directions   just like a star fish   thought alice  the poor little thing was snorting like a steam engine when she caught it  and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again  so that altogether  for the first minute or two  it was as much as she could do to hold it   as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it   which was to twist it up into a sort of knot  and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot  so as to prevent its undoing itself   she carried it out into the open air   if i don t take this child away with me   thought alice   they re sure to kill it in a day or two  wouldn t it be murder to leave it behind   she said the last words out loud  and the little thing grunted in reply  it had left off sneezing by this time    don t grunt   said alice   that s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself    the baby grunted again  and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it  there could be no doubt that it had a very turn up nose  much more like a snout than a real nose  also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby  altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all   but perhaps it was only sobbing   she thought  and looked into its eyes again  to see if there were any tears   no  there were no tears   if you re going to turn into a pig  my dear   said alice  seriously   i ll have nothing more to do with you  mind now   the poor little thing sobbed again  or grunted  it was impossible to say which   and they went on for some while in silence   alice was just beginning to think to herself   now  what am i to do with this creature when i get it home   when it grunted again  so violently  that she looked down into its face in some alarm  this time there could be no mistake about it  it was neither more nor less than a pig  and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further   so she set the little creature down  and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood   if it had grown up   she said to herself   it would have made a dreadfully ugly child  but it makes rather a handsome pig  i think   and she began thinking over other children she knew  who might do very well as pigs  and was just saying to herself   if one only knew the right way to change them    when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off   the cat only grinned when it saw alice  it looked good natured  she thought  still it had very long claws and a great many teeth  so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect    cheshire puss   she began  rather timidly  as she did not at all know whether it would like the name  however  it only grinned a little wider   come  it s pleased so far   thought alice  and she went on   would you tell me  please  which way i ought to go from here     that depends a good deal on where you want to get to   said the cat    i don t much care where    said alice    then it doesn t matter which way you go   said the cat      so long as i get somewhere   alice added as an explanation    oh  you re sure to do that   said the cat   if you only walk long enough    alice felt that this could not be denied  so she tried another question   what sort of people live about here     in that direction   the cat said  waving its right paw round   lives a hatter  and in that direction   waving the other paw   lives a march hare  visit either you like  they re both mad     but i don t want to go among mad people   alice remarked    oh  you can t help that   said the cat   we re all mad here  i m mad  you re mad     how do you know i m mad   said alice    you must be   said the cat   or you wouldn t have come here    alice didn t think that proved it at all  however  she went on  and how do you know that you re mad     to begin with   said the cat   a dog s not mad  you grant that     i suppose so   said alice    well  then   the cat went on   you see  a dog growls when it s angry  and wags its tail when it s pleased  now i growl when i m pleased  and wag my tail when i m angry  therefore i m mad     i call it purring  not growling   said alice    call it what you like   said the cat   do you play croquet with the queen to day     i should like it very much   said alice   but i haven t been invited yet     you ll see me there   said the cat  and vanished   alice was not much surprised at this  she was getting so used to queer things happening  while she was looking at the place where it had been  it suddenly appeared again    by the bye  what became of the baby   said the cat   i d nearly forgotten to ask     it turned into a pig   alice quietly said  just as if it had come back in a natural way    i thought it would   said the cat  and vanished again   alice waited a little  half expecting to see it again  but it did not appear  and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live   i ve seen hatters before   she said to herself   the march hare will be much the most interesting  and perhaps as this is may it won t be raving mad  at least not so mad as it was in march   as she said this  she looked up  and there was the cat again  sitting on a branch of a tree    did you say pig  or fig   said the cat    i said pig   replied alice   and i wish you wouldn t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly  you make one quite giddy     all right   said the cat  and this time it vanished quite slowly  beginning with the end of the tail  and ending with the grin  which remained some time after the rest of it had gone    well  i ve often seen a cat without a grin   thought alice   but a grin without a cat  it s the most curious thing i ever saw in my life    she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare  she thought it must be the right house  because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur  it was so large a house  that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom  and raised herself to about two feet high  even then she walked up towards it rather timidly  saying to herself  suppose it should be raving mad after all  i almost wish i d gone to see the hatter instead       chapter vii  a mad tea party  there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house  and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it  a dormouse was sitting between them  fast asleep  and the other two were using it as a cushion  resting their elbows on it  and talking over its head   very uncomfortable for the dormouse   thought alice   only  as it s asleep  i suppose it doesn t mind    the table was a large one  but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it   no room  no room   they cried out when they saw alice coming   there s plenty of room   said alice indignantly  and she sat down in a large arm chair at one end of the table    have some wine   the march hare said in an encouraging tone   alice looked all round the table  but there was nothing on it but tea   i don t see any wine   she remarked    there isn t any   said the march hare    then it wasn t very civil of you to offer it   said alice angrily    it wasn t very civil of you to sit down without being invited   said the march hare    i didn t know it was your table   said alice   it s laid for a great many more than three     your hair wants cutting   said the hatter  he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity  and this was his first speech    you should learn not to make personal remarks   alice said with some severity   it s very rude    the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this  but all he said was   why is a raven like a writing desk     come  we shall have some fun now   thought alice   i m glad they ve begun asking riddles   i believe i can guess that   she added aloud    do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it   said the march hare    exactly so   said alice    then you should say what you mean   the march hare went on    i do   alice hastily replied   at least  at least i mean what i say  that s the same thing  you know     not the same thing a bit   said the hatter   you might just as well say that  i see what i eat  is the same thing as  i eat what i see      you might just as well say   added the march hare   that  i like what i get  is the same thing as  i get what i like      you might just as well say   added the dormouse  who seemed to be talking in his sleep   that  i breathe when i sleep  is the same thing as  i sleep when i breathe      it is the same thing with you   said the hatter  and here the conversation dropped  and the party sat silent for a minute  while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing desks  which wasn t much   the hatter was the first to break the silence   what day of the month is it   he said  turning to alice  he had taken his watch out of his pocket  and was looking at it uneasily  shaking it every now and then  and holding it to his ear   alice considered a little  and then said  the fourth     two days wrong   sighed the hatter   i told you butter wouldn t suit the works   he added looking angrily at the march hare    it was the best butter   the march hare meekly replied    yes  but some crumbs must have got in as well   the hatter grumbled   you shouldn t have put it in with the bread knife    the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily  then he dipped it into his cup of tea  and looked at it again  but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark   it was the best butter  you know    alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity   what a funny watch   she remarked   it tells the day of the month  and doesn t tell what o clock it is     why should it   muttered the hatter   does your watch tell you what year it is     of course not   alice replied very readily   but that s because it stays the same year for such a long time together     which is just the case with mine   said the hatter   alice felt dreadfully puzzled  the hatter s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it  and yet it was certainly english   i don t quite understand you   she said  as politely as she could    the dormouse is asleep again   said the hatter  and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose   the dormouse shook its head impatiently  and said  without opening its eyes   of course  of course  just what i was going to remark myself     have you guessed the riddle yet   the hatter said  turning to alice again    no  i give it up   alice replied   what s the answer     i haven t the slightest idea   said the hatter    nor i   said the march hare   alice sighed wearily   i think you might do something better with the time   she said   than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers     if you knew time as well as i do   said the hatter   you wouldn t talk about wasting it  it s him     i don t know what you mean   said alice    of course you don t   the hatter said  tossing his head contemptuously   i dare say you never even spoke to time     perhaps not   alice cautiously replied   but i know i have to beat time when i learn music     ah  that accounts for it   said the hatter   he won t stand beating  now  if you only kept on good terms with him  he d do almost anything you liked with the clock  for instance  suppose it were nine o clock in the morning  just time to begin lessons  you d only have to whisper a hint to time  and round goes the clock in a twinkling  half past one  time for dinner      i only wish it was   the march hare said to itself in a whisper     that would be grand  certainly   said alice thoughtfully   but then  i shouldn t be hungry for it  you know     not at first  perhaps   said the hatter   but you could keep it to half past one as long as you liked     is that the way you manage   alice asked   the hatter shook his head mournfully   not i   he replied   we quarrelled last march  just before he went mad  you know     pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare      it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts  and i had to sing        twinkle  twinkle  little bat       how i wonder what you re at    you know the song  perhaps     i ve heard something like it   said alice    it goes on  you know   the hatter continued   in this way           up above the world you fly       like a tea tray in the sky           twinkle  twinkle      here the dormouse shook itself  and began singing in its sleep  twinkle  twinkle  twinkle  twinkle    and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop    well  i d hardly finished the first verse   said the hatter   when the queen jumped up and bawled out   he s murdering the time  off with his head      how dreadfully savage   exclaimed alice    and ever since that   the hatter went on in a mournful tone   he won t do a thing i ask  it s always six o clock now    a bright idea came into alice s head   is that the reason so many tea things are put out here   she asked    yes  that s it   said the hatter with a sigh   it s always tea time  and we ve no time to wash the things between whiles     then you keep moving round  i suppose   said alice    exactly so   said the hatter   as the things get used up     but what happens when you come to the beginning again   alice ventured to ask    suppose we change the subject   the march hare interrupted  yawning   i m getting tired of this  i vote the young lady tells us a story     i m afraid i don t know one   said alice  rather alarmed at the proposal    then the dormouse shall   they both cried   wake up  dormouse   and they pinched it on both sides at once   the dormouse slowly opened his eyes   i wasn t asleep   he said in a hoarse  feeble voice   i heard every word you fellows were saying     tell us a story   said the march hare    yes  please do   pleaded alice    and be quick about it   added the hatter   or you ll be asleep again before it s done     once upon a time there were three little sisters   the dormouse began in a great hurry   and their names were elsie  lacie  and tillie  and they lived at the bottom of a well      what did they live on   said alice  who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking    they lived on treacle   said the dormouse  after thinking a minute or two    they couldn t have done that  you know   alice gently remarked   they d have been ill     so they were   said the dormouse   very ill    alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like  but it puzzled her too much  so she went on   but why did they live at the bottom of a well     take some more tea   the march hare said to alice  very earnestly    i ve had nothing yet   alice replied in an offended tone   so i can t take more     you mean you can t take less   said the hatter   it s very easy to take more than nothing     nobody asked your opinion   said alice    who s making personal remarks now   the hatter asked triumphantly   alice did not quite know what to say to this  so she helped herself to some tea and bread and butter  and then turned to the dormouse  and repeated her question   why did they live at the bottom of a well    the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it  and then said   it was a treacle well     there s no such thing   alice was beginning very angrily  but the hatter and the march hare went  sh  sh   and the dormouse sulkily remarked   if you can t be civil  you d better finish the story for yourself     no  please go on   alice said very humbly   i won t interrupt again  i dare say there may be one     one  indeed   said the dormouse indignantly  however  he consented to go on   and so these three little sisters  they were learning to draw  you know      what did they draw   said alice  quite forgetting her promise    treacle   said the dormouse  without considering at all this time    i want a clean cup   interrupted the hatter   let s all move one place on    he moved on as he spoke  and the dormouse followed him  the march hare moved into the dormouse s place  and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare  the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change  and alice was a good deal worse off than before  as the march hare had just upset the milk jug into his plate   alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again  so she began very cautiously   but i don t understand  where did they draw the treacle from     you can draw water out of a water well   said the hatter   so i should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle well  eh  stupid     but they were in the well   alice said to the dormouse  not choosing to notice this last remark    of course they were   said the dormouse     well in    this answer so confused poor alice  that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it    they were learning to draw   the dormouse went on  yawning and rubbing its eyes  for it was getting very sleepy   and they drew all manner of things  everything that begins with an m      why with an m   said alice    why not   said the march hare   alice was silent   the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time  and was going off into a doze  but  on being pinched by the hatter  it woke up again with a little shriek  and went on     that begins with an m  such as mouse traps  and the moon  and memory  and muchness  you know you say things are  much of a muchness   did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness     really  now you ask me   said alice  very much confused   i don t think      then you shouldn t talk   said the hatter   this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear  she got up in great disgust  and walked off  the dormouse fell asleep instantly  and neither of the others took the least notice of her going  though she looked back once or twice  half hoping that they would call after her  the last time she saw them  they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot    at any rate i ll never go there again   said alice as she picked her way through the wood   it s the stupidest tea party i ever was at in all my life    just as she said this  she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it   that s very curious   she thought   but everything s curious today  i think i may as well go in at once   and in she went   once more she found herself in the long hall  and close to the little glass table   now  i ll manage better this time   she said to herself  and began by taking the little golden key  and unlocking the door that led into the garden  then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom  she had kept a piece of it in her pocket  till she was about a foot high  then she walked down the little passage  and then  she found herself at last in the beautiful garden  among the bright flower beds and the cool fountains      chapter viii  the queen s croquet ground  a large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden  the roses growing on it were white  but there were three gardeners at it  busily painting them red  alice thought this a very curious thing  and she went nearer to watch them  and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say   look out now  five  don t go splashing paint over me like that     i couldn t help it   said five  in a sulky tone   seven jogged my elbow    on which seven looked up and said   that s right  five  always lay the blame on others     you d better not talk   said five   i heard the queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded     what for   said the one who had spoken first    that s none of your business  two   said seven    yes  it is his business   said five   and i ll tell him  it was for bringing the cook tulip roots instead of onions    seven flung down his brush  and had just begun  well  of all the unjust things    when his eye chanced to fall upon alice  as she stood watching them  and he checked himself suddenly  the others looked round also  and all of them bowed low    would you tell me   said alice  a little timidly   why you are painting those roses    five and seven said nothing  but looked at two  two began in a low voice   why the fact is  you see  miss  this here ought to have been a red rose tree  and we put a white one in by mistake  and if the queen was to find it out  we should all have our heads cut off  you know  so you see  miss  we re doing our best  afore she comes  to    at this moment five  who had been anxiously looking across the garden  called out  the queen  the queen   and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces  there was a sound of many footsteps  and alice looked round  eager to see the queen   first came ten soldiers carrying clubs  these were all shaped like the three gardeners  oblong and flat  with their hands and feet at the corners  next the ten courtiers  these were ornamented all over with diamonds  and walked two and two  as the soldiers did  after these came the royal children  there were ten of them  and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand  in couples  they were all ornamented with hearts  next came the guests  mostly kings and queens  and among them alice recognised the white rabbit  it was talking in a hurried nervous manner  smiling at everything that was said  and went by without noticing her  then followed the knave of hearts  carrying the king s crown on a crimson velvet cushion  and  last of all this grand procession  came the king and queen of hearts   alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners  but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions   and besides  what would be the use of a procession   thought she   if people had all to lie down upon their faces  so that they couldn t see it   so she stood still where she was  and waited   when the procession came opposite to alice  they all stopped and looked at her  and the queen said severely  who is this   she said it to the knave of hearts  who only bowed and smiled in reply    idiot   said the queen  tossing her head impatiently  and  turning to alice  she went on   what s your name  child     my name is alice  so please your majesty   said alice very politely  but she added  to herself   why  they re only a pack of cards  after all  i needn t be afraid of them     and who are these   said the queen  pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree  for  you see  as they were lying on their faces  and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack  she could not tell whether they were gardeners  or soldiers  or courtiers  or three of her own children    how should i know   said alice  surprised at her own courage   it s no business of mine    the queen turned crimson with fury  and  after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast  screamed  off with her head  off      nonsense   said alice  very loudly and decidedly  and the queen was silent   the king laid his hand upon her arm  and timidly said  consider  my dear  she is only a child    the queen turned angrily away from him  and said to the knave  turn them over    the knave did so  very carefully  with one foot    get up   said the queen  in a shrill  loud voice  and the three gardeners instantly jumped up  and began bowing to the king  the queen  the royal children  and everybody else    leave off that   screamed the queen   you make me giddy   and then  turning to the rose tree  she went on   what have you been doing here     may it please your majesty   said two  in a very humble tone  going down on one knee as he spoke   we were trying      i see   said the queen  who had meanwhile been examining the roses   off with their heads   and the procession moved on  three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners  who ran to alice for protection    you shan t be beheaded   said alice  and she put them into a large flower pot that stood near  the three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two  looking for them  and then quietly marched off after the others    are their heads off   shouted the queen    their heads are gone  if it please your majesty   the soldiers shouted in reply    that s right   shouted the queen   can you play croquet    the soldiers were silent  and looked at alice  as the question was evidently meant for her    yes   shouted alice    come on  then   roared the queen  and alice joined the procession  wondering very much what would happen next    it s  it s a very fine day   said a timid voice at her side  she was walking by the white rabbit  who was peeping anxiously into her face    very   said alice     where s the duchess     hush  hush   said the rabbit in a low  hurried tone  he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke  and then raised himself upon tiptoe  put his mouth close to her ear  and whispered  she s under sentence of execution     what for   said alice    did you say  what a pity     the rabbit asked    no  i didn t   said alice   i don t think it s at all a pity  i said  what for      she boxed the queen s ears    the rabbit began  alice gave a little scream of laughter   oh  hush   the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone   the queen will hear you  you see  she came rather late  and the queen said      get to your places   shouted the queen in a voice of thunder  and people began running about in all directions  tumbling up against each other  however  they got settled down in a minute or two  and the game began  alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life  it was all ridges and furrows  the balls were live hedgehogs  the mallets live flamingoes  and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet  to make the arches   the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away  comfortably enough  under her arm  with its legs hanging down  but generally  just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out  and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head  it would twist itself round and look up in her face  with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing  and when she had got its head down  and was going to begin again  it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself  and was in the act of crawling away  besides all this  there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to  and  as the doubled up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground  alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed   the players all played at once without waiting for turns  quarrelling all the while  and fighting for the hedgehogs  and in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion  and went stamping about  and shouting  off with his head   or  off with her head   about once in a minute   alice began to feel very uneasy  to be sure  she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen  but she knew that it might happen any minute   and then   thought she   what would become of me  they re dreadfully fond of beheading people here  the great wonder is  that there s any one left alive    she was looking about for some way of escape  and wondering whether she could get away without being seen  when she noticed a curious appearance in the air  it puzzled her very much at first  but  after watching it a minute or two  she made it out to be a grin  and she said to herself  it s the cheshire cat  now i shall have somebody to talk to     how are you getting on   said the cat  as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with   alice waited till the eyes appeared  and then nodded   it s no use speaking to it   she thought   till its ears have come  or at least one of them   in another minute the whole head appeared  and then alice put down her flamingo  and began an account of the game  feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her  the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight  and no more of it appeared    i don t think they play at all fairly   alice began  in rather a complaining tone   and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can t hear oneself speak  and they don t seem to have any rules in particular  at least  if there are  nobody attends to them  and you ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive  for instance  there s the arch i ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground  and i should have croqueted the queen s hedgehog just now  only it ran away when it saw mine coming     how do you like the queen   said the cat in a low voice    not at all   said alice   she s so extremely    just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her  listening  so she went on     likely to win  that it s hardly worth while finishing the game    the queen smiled and passed on    who are you talking to   said the king  going up to alice  and looking at the cat s head with great curiosity    it s a friend of mine  a cheshire cat   said alice   allow me to introduce it     i don t like the look of it at all   said the king   however  it may kiss my hand if it likes     i d rather not   the cat remarked    don t be impertinent   said the king   and don t look at me like that   he got behind alice as he spoke    a cat may look at a king   said alice   i ve read that in some book  but i don t remember where     well  it must be removed   said the king very decidedly  and he called the queen  who was passing at the moment   my dear  i wish you would have this cat removed    the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties  great or small   off with his head   she said  without even looking round    i ll fetch the executioner myself   said the king eagerly  and he hurried off   alice thought she might as well go back  and see how the game was going on  as she heard the queen s voice in the distance  screaming with passion  she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns  and she did not like the look of things at all  as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not  so she went in search of her hedgehog   the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog  which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other  the only difficulty was  that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden  where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree   by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back  the fight was over  and both the hedgehogs were out of sight   but it doesn t matter much   thought alice   as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground   so she tucked it away under her arm  that it might not escape again  and went back for a little more conversation with her friend   when she got back to the cheshire cat  she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it  there was a dispute going on between the executioner  the king  and the queen  who were all talking at once  while all the rest were quite silent  and looked very uncomfortable   the moment alice appeared  she was appealed to by all three to settle the question  and they repeated their arguments to her  though  as they all spoke at once  she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said   the executioner s argument was  that you couldn t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from  that he had never had to do such a thing before  and he wasn t going to begin at his time of life   the king s argument was  that anything that had a head could be beheaded  and that you weren t to talk nonsense   the queen s argument was  that if something wasn t done about it in less than no time she d have everybody executed  all round   it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious    alice could think of nothing else to say but  it belongs to the duchess  you d better ask her about it     she s in prison   the queen said to the executioner   fetch her here   and the executioner went off like an arrow    the cat s head began fading away the moment he was gone  and  by the time he had come back with the duchess  it had entirely disappeared  so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it  while the rest of the party went back to the game      chapter ix  the mock turtle s story   you can t think how glad i am to see you again  you dear old thing   said the duchess  as she tucked her arm affectionately into alice s  and they walked off together   alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper  and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen    when i m a duchess   she said to herself   not in a very hopeful tone though    i won t have any pepper in my kitchen at all  soup does very well without  maybe it s always pepper that makes people hot tempered   she went on  very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule   and vinegar that makes them sour  and camomile that makes them bitter  and  and barley sugar and such things that make children sweet tempered  i only wish people knew that  then they wouldn t be so stingy about it  you know     she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time  and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear   you re thinking about something  my dear  and that makes you forget to talk  i can t tell you just now what the moral of that is  but i shall remember it in a bit     perhaps it hasn t one   alice ventured to remark    tut  tut  child   said the duchess   everything s got a moral  if only you can find it   and she squeezed herself up closer to alice s side as she spoke   alice did not much like keeping so close to her  first  because the duchess was very ugly  and secondly  because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alice s shoulder  and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin  however  she did not like to be rude  so she bore it as well as she could    the game s going on rather better now   she said  by way of keeping up the conversation a little     tis so   said the duchess   and the moral of that is   oh   tis love   tis love  that makes the world go round      somebody said   alice whispered   that it s done by everybody minding their own business     ah  well  it means much the same thing   said the duchess  digging her sharp little chin into alice s shoulder as she added   and the moral of that is   take care of the sense  and the sounds will take care of themselves      how fond she is of finding morals in things   alice thought to herself    i dare say you re wondering why i don t put my arm round your waist   the duchess said after a pause   the reason is  that i m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo  shall i try the experiment     he might bite   alice cautiously replied  not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried    very true   said the duchess   flamingoes and mustard both bite  and the moral of that is   birds of a feather flock together      only mustard isn t a bird   alice remarked    right  as usual   said the duchess   what a clear way you have of putting things     it s a mineral  i think   said alice    of course it is   said the duchess  who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said   there s a large mustard mine near here  and the moral of that is   the more there is of mine  the less there is of yours      oh  i know   exclaimed alice  who had not attended to this last remark   it s a vegetable  it doesn t look like one  but it is     i quite agree with you   said the duchess   and the moral of that is   be what you would seem to be   or if you d like it put more simply   never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise      i think i should understand that better   alice said very politely   if i had it written down  but i can t quite follow it as you say it     that s nothing to what i could say if i chose   the duchess replied  in a pleased tone    pray don t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that   said alice    oh  don t talk about trouble   said the duchess   i make you a present of everything i ve said as yet     a cheap sort of present   thought alice   i m glad they don t give birthday presents like that   but she did not venture to say it out loud    thinking again   the duchess asked  with another dig of her sharp little chin    i ve a right to think   said alice sharply  for she was beginning to feel a little worried    just about as much right   said the duchess   as pigs have to fly  and the m     but here  to alice s great surprise  the duchess s voice died away  even in the middle of her favourite word  moral   and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble  alice looked up  and there stood the queen in front of them  with her arms folded  frowning like a thunderstorm    a fine day  your majesty   the duchess began in a low  weak voice    now  i give you fair warning   shouted the queen  stamping on the ground as she spoke   either you or your head must be off  and that in about half no time  take your choice    the duchess took her choice  and was gone in a moment    let s go on with the game   the queen said to alice  and alice was too much frightened to say a word  but slowly followed her back to the croquet ground   the other guests had taken advantage of the queen s absence  and were resting in the shade  however  the moment they saw her  they hurried back to the game  the queen merely remarking that a moment s delay would cost them their lives   all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players  and shouting  off with his head   or  off with her head   those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers  who of course had to leave off being arches to do this  so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left  and all the players  except the king  the queen  and alice  were in custody and under sentence of execution   then the queen left off  quite out of breath  and said to alice   have you seen the mock turtle yet     no   said alice   i don t even know what a mock turtle is     it s the thing mock turtle soup is made from   said the queen    i never saw one  or heard of one   said alice    come on  then   said the queen   and he shall tell you his history    as they walked off together  alice heard the king say in a low voice  to the company generally   you are all pardoned    come  that s a good thing   she said to herself  for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered   they very soon came upon a gryphon  lying fast asleep in the sun   if you don t know what a gryphon is  look at the picture    up  lazy thing   said the queen   and take this young lady to see the mock turtle  and to hear his history  i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered   and she walked off  leaving alice alone with the gryphon  alice did not quite like the look of the creature  but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage queen  so she waited   the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes  then it watched the queen till she was out of sight  then it chuckled   what fun   said the gryphon  half to itself  half to alice    what is the fun   said alice    why  she   said the gryphon   it s all her fancy  that  they never executes nobody  you know  come on     everybody says  come on   here   thought alice  as she went slowly after it   i never was so ordered about in all my life  never    they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance  sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock  and  as they came nearer  alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break  she pitied him deeply   what is his sorrow   she asked the gryphon  and the gryphon answered  very nearly in the same words as before   it s all his fancy  that  he hasn t got no sorrow  you know  come on    so they went up to the mock turtle  who looked at them with large eyes full of tears  but said nothing    this here young lady   said the gryphon   she wants for to know your history  she do     i ll tell it her   said the mock turtle in a deep  hollow tone   sit down  both of you  and don t speak a word till i ve finished    so they sat down  and nobody spoke for some minutes  alice thought to herself   i don t see how he can even finish  if he doesn t begin   but she waited patiently    once   said the mock turtle at last  with a deep sigh   i was a real turtle    these words were followed by a very long silence  broken only by an occasional exclamation of  hjckrrh   from the gryphon  and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle  alice was very nearly getting up and saying   thank you  sir  for your interesting story   but she could not help thinking there must be more to come  so she sat still and said nothing    when we were little   the mock turtle went on at last  more calmly  though still sobbing a little now and then   we went to school in the sea  the master was an old turtle  we used to call him tortoise      why did you call him tortoise  if he wasn t one   alice asked    we called him tortoise because he taught us   said the mock turtle angrily   really you are very dull     you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question   added the gryphon  and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice  who felt ready to sink into the earth  at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle   drive on  old fellow  don t be all day about it   and he went on in these words    yes  we went to school in the sea  though you mayn t believe it      i never said i didn t   interrupted alice    you did   said the mock turtle    hold your tongue   added the gryphon  before alice could speak again  the mock turtle went on    we had the best of educations  in fact  we went to school every day      i ve been to a day school  too   said alice   you needn t be so proud as all that     with extras   asked the mock turtle a little anxiously    yes   said alice   we learned french and music     and washing   said the mock turtle    certainly not   said alice indignantly    ah  then yours wasn t a really good school   said the mock turtle in a tone of great relief   now at ours they had at the end of the bill   french  music  and washing  extra      you couldn t have wanted it much   said alice   living at the bottom of the sea     i couldn t afford to learn it   said the mock turtle with a sigh   i only took the regular course     what was that   inquired alice    reeling and writhing  of course  to begin with   the mock turtle replied   and then the different branches of arithmetic  ambition  distraction  uglification  and derision     i never heard of  uglification    alice ventured to say   what is it    the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise   what  never heard of uglifying   it exclaimed   you know what to beautify is  i suppose     yes   said alice doubtfully   it means  to  make  anything  prettier     well  then   the gryphon went on   if you don t know what to uglify is  you are a simpleton    alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it  so she turned to the mock turtle  and said  what else had you to learn     well  there was mystery   the mock turtle replied  counting off the subjects on his flappers     mystery  ancient and modern  with seaography  then drawling  the drawling master was an old conger eel  that used to come once a week  he taught us drawling  stretching  and fainting in coils     what was that like   said alice    well  i can t show it you myself   the mock turtle said   i m too stiff  and the gryphon never learnt it     hadn t time   said the gryphon   i went to the classics master  though  he was an old crab  he was     i never went to him   the mock turtle said with a sigh   he taught laughing and grief  they used to say     so he did  so he did   said the gryphon  sighing in his turn  and both creatures hid their faces in their paws    and how many hours a day did you do lessons   said alice  in a hurry to change the subject    ten hours the first day   said the mock turtle   nine the next  and so on     what a curious plan   exclaimed alice    that s the reason they re called lessons   the gryphon remarked   because they lessen from day to day    this was quite a new idea to alice  and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark   then the eleventh day must have been a holiday     of course it was   said the mock turtle    and how did you manage on the twelfth   alice went on eagerly    that s enough about lessons   the gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone   tell her something about the games now       chapter x  the lobster quadrille  the mock turtle sighed deeply  and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes  he looked at alice  and tried to speak  but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice   same as if he had a bone in his throat   said the gryphon  and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back  at last the mock turtle recovered his voice  and  with tears running down his cheeks  he went on again      you may not have lived much under the sea      i haven t   said alice    and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster     alice began to say  i once tasted    but checked herself hastily  and said  no  never      so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is     no  indeed   said alice   what sort of a dance is it     why   said the gryphon   you first form into a line along the sea shore      two lines   cried the mock turtle   seals  turtles  salmon  and so on  then  when you ve cleared all the jelly fish out of the way      that generally takes some time   interrupted the gryphon      you advance twice      each with a lobster as a partner   cried the gryphon    of course   the mock turtle said   advance twice  set to partners        change lobsters  and retire in same order   continued the gryphon    then  you know   the mock turtle went on   you throw the      the lobsters   shouted the gryphon  with a bound into the air      as far out to sea as you can      swim after them   screamed the gryphon    turn a somersault in the sea   cried the mock turtle  capering wildly about    change lobsters again   yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice    back to land again  and that s all the first figure   said the mock turtle  suddenly dropping his voice  and the two creatures  who had been jumping about like mad things all this time  sat down again very sadly and quietly  and looked at alice    it must be a very pretty dance   said alice timidly    would you like to see a little of it   said the mock turtle    very much indeed   said alice    come  let s try the first figure   said the mock turtle to the gryphon   we can do without lobsters  you know  which shall sing     oh  you sing   said the gryphon   i ve forgotten the words    so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice  every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close  and waving their forepaws to mark the time  while the mock turtle sang this  very slowly and sadly        will you walk a little faster   said a whiting to a snail    there s a porpoise close behind us  and he s treading on my tail    see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance   they are waiting on the shingle  will you come and join the dance    will you  won t you  will you  won t you  will you join the dance   will you  won t you  will you  won t you  won t you join the dance     you can really have no notion how delightful it will be  when they take us up and throw us  with the lobsters  out to sea     but the snail replied  too far  too far   and gave a look askance    said he thanked the whiting kindly  but he would not join the dance    would not  could not  would not  could not  would not join the dance   would not  could not  would not  could not  could not join the dance      what matters it how far we go   his scaly friend replied    there is another shore  you know  upon the other side   the further off from england the nearer is to france    then turn not pale  beloved snail  but come and join the dance    will you  won t you  will you  won t you  will you join the dance   will you  won t you  will you  won t you  won t you join the dance      thank you  it s a very interesting dance to watch   said alice  feeling very glad that it was over at last   and i do so like that curious song about the whiting     oh  as to the whiting   said the mock turtle   they  you ve seen them  of course     yes   said alice   i ve often seen them at dinn    she checked herself hastily    i don t know where dinn may be   said the mock turtle   but if you ve seen them so often  of course you know what they re like     i believe so   alice replied thoughtfully   they have their tails in their mouths  and they re all over crumbs     you re wrong about the crumbs   said the mock turtle   crumbs would all wash off in the sea  but they have their tails in their mouths  and the reason is    here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes    tell her about the reason and all that   he said to the gryphon    the reason is   said the gryphon   that they would go with the lobsters to the dance  so they got thrown out to sea  so they had to fall a long way  so they got their tails fast in their mouths  so they couldn t get them out again  that s all     thank you   said alice   it s very interesting  i never knew so much about a whiting before     i can tell you more than that  if you like   said the gryphon   do you know why it s called a whiting     i never thought about it   said alice   why     it does the boots and shoes   the gryphon replied very solemnly   alice was thoroughly puzzled   does the boots and shoes   she repeated in a wondering tone    why  what are your shoes done with   said the gryphon   i mean  what makes them so shiny    alice looked down at them  and considered a little before she gave her answer   they re done with blacking  i believe     boots and shoes under the sea   the gryphon went on in a deep voice   are done with a whiting  now you know     and what are they made of   alice asked in a tone of great curiosity    soles and eels  of course   the gryphon replied rather impatiently   any shrimp could have told you that     if i d been the whiting   said alice  whose thoughts were still running on the song   i d have said to the porpoise   keep back  please  we don t want you with us      they were obliged to have him with them   the mock turtle said   no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise     wouldn t it really   said alice in a tone of great surprise    of course not   said the mock turtle   why  if a fish came to me  and told me he was going a journey  i should say  with what porpoise      don t you mean  purpose    said alice    i mean what i say   the mock turtle replied in an offended tone  and the gryphon added  come  let s hear some of your adventures     i could tell you my adventures  beginning from this morning   said alice a little timidly   but it s no use going back to yesterday  because i was a different person then     explain all that   said the mock turtle    no  no  the adventures first   said the gryphon in an impatient tone   explanations take such a dreadful time    so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the white rabbit  she was a little nervous about it just at first  the two creatures got so close to her  one on each side  and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide  but she gained courage as she went on  her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating  you are old  father william   to the caterpillar  and the words all coming different  and then the mock turtle drew a long breath  and said  that s very curious     it s all about as curious as it can be   said the gryphon    it all came different   the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully   i should like to hear her try and repeat something now  tell her to begin   he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice    stand up and repeat   tis the voice of the sluggard    said the gryphon    how the creatures order one about  and make one repeat lessons   thought alice   i might as well be at school at once   however  she got up  and began to repeat it  but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille  that she hardly knew what she was saying  and the words came very queer indeed         tis the voice of the lobster  i heard him declare     you have baked me too brown  i must sugar my hair      as a duck with its eyelids  so he with his nose   trims his belt and his buttons  and turns out his toes            later editions continued as follows   when the sands are all dry  he is gay as a lark    and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark    but  when the tide rises and sharks are around    his voice has a timid and tremulous sound     that s different from what i used to say when i was a child   said the gryphon    well  i never heard it before   said the mock turtle   but it sounds uncommon nonsense    alice said nothing  she had sat down with her face in her hands  wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again    i should like to have it explained   said the mock turtle    she can t explain it   said the gryphon hastily   go on with the next verse     but about his toes   the mock turtle persisted   how could he turn them out with his nose  you know     it s the first position in dancing   alice said  but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing  and longed to change the subject    go on with the next verse   the gryphon repeated impatiently   it begins  i passed by his garden     alice did not dare to disobey  though she felt sure it would all come wrong  and she went on in a trembling voice        i passed by his garden  and marked  with one eye    how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie          later editions continued as follows   the panther took pie crust  and gravy  and meat    while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat    when the pie was all finished  the owl  as a boon    was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon    while the panther received knife and fork with a growl    and concluded the banquet      what is the use of repeating all that stuff   the mock turtle interrupted   if you don t explain it as you go on  it s by far the most confusing thing i ever heard     yes  i think you d better leave off   said the gryphon  and alice was only too glad to do so    shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille   the gryphon went on   or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song     oh  a song  please  if the mock turtle would be so kind   alice replied  so eagerly that the gryphon said  in a rather offended tone   hm  no accounting for tastes  sing her  turtle soup   will you  old fellow    the mock turtle sighed deeply  and began  in a voice sometimes choked with sobs  to sing this         beautiful soup  so rich and green     waiting in a hot tureen     who for such dainties would not stoop     soup of the evening  beautiful soup     soup of the evening  beautiful soup       beau  ootiful soo  oop       beau  ootiful soo  oop     soo  oop of the e  e  evening       beautiful  beautiful soup       beautiful soup  who cares for fish     game  or any other dish     who would not give all else for two    pennyworth only of beautiful soup     pennyworth only of beautiful soup       beau  ootiful soo  oop       beau  ootiful soo  oop     soo  oop of the e  e  evening       beautiful  beauti  ful soup     chorus again   cried the gryphon  and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it  when a cry of  the trial s beginning   was heard in the distance    come on   cried the gryphon  and  taking alice by the hand  it hurried off  without waiting for the end of the song    what trial is it   alice panted as she ran  but the gryphon only answered  come on   and ran the faster  while more and more faintly came  carried on the breeze that followed them  the melancholy words         soo  oop of the e  e  evening       beautiful  beautiful soup       chapter xi  who stole the tarts   the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived  with a great crowd assembled about them  all sorts of little birds and beasts  as well as the whole pack of cards  the knave was standing before them  in chains  with a soldier on each side to guard him  and near the king was the white rabbit  with a trumpet in one hand  and a scroll of parchment in the other  in the very middle of the court was a table  with a large dish of tarts upon it  they looked so good  that it made alice quite hungry to look at them   i wish they d get the trial done   she thought   and hand round the refreshments   but there seemed to be no chance of this  so she began looking at everything about her  to pass away the time   alice had never been in a court of justice before  but she had read about them in books  and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there   that s the judge   she said to herself   because of his great wig    the judge  by the way  was the king  and as he wore his crown over the wig   look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it   he did not look at all comfortable  and it was certainly not becoming    and that s the jury box   thought alice   and those twelve creatures    she was obliged to say  creatures   you see  because some of them were animals  and some were birds    i suppose they are the jurors   she said this last word two or three times over to herself  being rather proud of it  for she thought  and rightly too  that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all  however   jury men  would have done just as well   the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates   what are they doing   alice whispered to the gryphon   they can t have anything to put down yet  before the trial s begun     they re putting down their names   the gryphon whispered in reply   for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial     stupid things   alice began in a loud  indignant voice  but she stopped hastily  for the white rabbit cried out   silence in the court   and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round  to make out who was talking   alice could see  as well as if she were looking over their shoulders  that all the jurors were writing down  stupid things   on their slates  and she could even make out that one of them didn t know how to spell  stupid   and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him   a nice muddle their slates ll be in before the trial s over   thought alice   one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked  this of course  alice could not stand  and she went round the court and got behind him  and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away  she did it so quickly that the poor little juror  it was bill  the lizard  could not make out at all what had become of it  so  after hunting all about for it  he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day  and this was of very little use  as it left no mark on the slate    herald  read the accusation   said the king   on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet  and then unrolled the parchment scroll  and read as follows         the queen of hearts  she made some tarts        all on a summer day      the knave of hearts  he stole those tarts        and took them quite away     consider your verdict   the king said to the jury    not yet  not yet   the rabbit hastily interrupted   there s a great deal to come before that     call the first witness   said the king  and the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet  and called out   first witness    the first witness was the hatter  he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other   i beg pardon  your majesty   he began   for bringing these in  but i hadn t quite finished my tea when i was sent for     you ought to have finished   said the king   when did you begin    the hatter looked at the march hare  who had followed him into the court  arm in arm with the dormouse   fourteenth of march  i think it was   he said    fifteenth   said the march hare    sixteenth   added the dormouse    write that down   the king said to the jury  and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates  and then added them up  and reduced the answer to shillings and pence    take off your hat   the king said to the hatter    it isn t mine   said the hatter    stolen   the king exclaimed  turning to the jury  who instantly made a memorandum of the fact    i keep them to sell   the hatter added as an explanation   i ve none of my own  i m a hatter    here the queen put on her spectacles  and began staring at the hatter  who turned pale and fidgeted    give your evidence   said the king   and don t be nervous  or i ll have you executed on the spot    this did not seem to encourage the witness at all  he kept shifting from one foot to the other  looking uneasily at the queen  and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter   just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation  which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was  she was beginning to grow larger again  and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court  but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her    i wish you wouldn t squeeze so   said the dormouse  who was sitting next to her   i can hardly breathe     i can t help it   said alice very meekly   i m growing     you ve no right to grow here   said the dormouse    don t talk nonsense   said alice more boldly   you know you re growing too     yes  but i grow at a reasonable pace   said the dormouse   not in that ridiculous fashion   and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court   all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter  and  just as the dormouse crossed the court  she said to one of the officers of the court   bring me the list of the singers in the last concert   on which the wretched hatter trembled so  that he shook both his shoes off    give your evidence   the king repeated angrily   or i ll have you executed  whether you re nervous or not     i m a poor man  your majesty   the hatter began  in a trembling voice     and i hadn t begun my tea  not above a week or so  and what with the bread and butter getting so thin  and the twinkling of the tea      the twinkling of the what   said the king    it began with the tea   the hatter replied    of course twinkling begins with a t   said the king sharply   do you take me for a dunce  go on     i m a poor man   the hatter went on   and most things twinkled after that  only the march hare said      i didn t   the march hare interrupted in a great hurry    you did   said the hatter    i deny it   said the march hare    he denies it   said the king   leave out that part     well  at any rate  the dormouse said    the hatter went on  looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too  but the dormouse denied nothing  being fast asleep    after that   continued the hatter   i cut some more bread and butter      but what did the dormouse say   one of the jury asked    that i can t remember   said the hatter    you must remember   remarked the king   or i ll have you executed    the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter  and went down on one knee   i m a poor man  your majesty   he began    you re a very poor speaker   said the king   here one of the guinea pigs cheered  and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court   as that is rather a hard word  i will just explain to you how it was done  they had a large canvas bag  which tied up at the mouth with strings  into this they slipped the guinea pig  head first  and then sat upon it     i m glad i ve seen that done   thought alice   i ve so often read in the newspapers  at the end of trials   there was some attempts at applause  which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court   and i never understood what it meant till now     if that s all you know about it  you may stand down   continued the king    i can t go no lower   said the hatter   i m on the floor  as it is     then you may sit down   the king replied   here the other guinea pig cheered  and was suppressed    come  that finished the guinea pigs   thought alice   now we shall get on better     i d rather finish my tea   said the hatter  with an anxious look at the queen  who was reading the list of singers    you may go   said the king  and the hatter hurriedly left the court  without even waiting to put his shoes on      and just take his head off outside   the queen added to one of the officers  but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door    call the next witness   said the king   the next witness was the duchess s cook  she carried the pepper box in her hand  and alice guessed who it was  even before she got into the court  by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once    give your evidence   said the king    shan t   said the cook   the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit  who said in a low voice   your majesty must cross examine this witness     well  if i must  i must   the king said  with a melancholy air  and  after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight  he said in a deep voice   what are tarts made of     pepper  mostly   said the cook    treacle   said a sleepy voice behind her    collar that dormouse   the queen shrieked out   behead that dormouse  turn that dormouse out of court  suppress him  pinch him  off with his whiskers    for some minutes the whole court was in confusion  getting the dormouse turned out  and  by the time they had settled down again  the cook had disappeared    never mind   said the king  with an air of great relief   call the next witness   and he added in an undertone to the queen   really  my dear  you must cross examine the next witness  it quite makes my forehead ache    alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list  feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like     for they haven t got much evidence yet   she said to herself  imagine her surprise  when the white rabbit read out  at the top of his shrill little voice  the name  alice       chapter xii  alice s evidence    here   cried alice  quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes  and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury box with the edge of her skirt  upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below  and there they lay sprawling about  reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before    oh  i beg your pardon   she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay  and began picking them up again as quickly as she could  for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head  and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury box  or they would die    the trial cannot proceed   said the king in a very grave voice   until all the jurymen are back in their proper places  all   he repeated with great emphasis  looking hard at alice as he said do   alice looked at the jury box  and saw that  in her haste  she had put the lizard in head downwards  and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way  being quite unable to move  she soon got it out again  and put it right   not that it signifies much   she said to herself   i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other    as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset  and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them  they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident  all except the lizard  who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open  gazing up into the roof of the court    what do you know about this business   the king said to alice    nothing   said alice    nothing whatever   persisted the king    nothing whatever   said alice    that s very important   the king said  turning to the jury  they were just beginning to write this down on their slates  when the white rabbit interrupted   unimportant  your majesty means  of course   he said in a very respectful tone  but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke    unimportant  of course  i meant   the king hastily said  and went on to himself in an undertone    important  unimportant  unimportant  important    as if he were trying which word sounded best   some of the jury wrote it down  important   and some  unimportant   alice could see this  as she was near enough to look over their slates   but it doesn t matter a bit   she thought to herself   at this moment the king  who had been for some time busily writing in his note book  cackled out  silence   and read out from his book   rule forty two  all persons more than a mile high to leave the court    everybody looked at alice    i m not a mile high   said alice    you are   said the king    nearly two miles high   added the queen    well  i shan t go  at any rate   said alice   besides  that s not a regular rule  you invented it just now     it s the oldest rule in the book   said the king    then it ought to be number one   said alice   the king turned pale  and shut his note book hastily   consider your verdict   he said to the jury  in a low  trembling voice    there s more evidence to come yet  please your majesty   said the white rabbit  jumping up in a great hurry   this paper has just been picked up     what s in it   said the queen    i haven t opened it yet   said the white rabbit   but it seems to be a letter  written by the prisoner to  to somebody     it must have been that   said the king   unless it was written to nobody  which isn t usual  you know     who is it directed to   said one of the jurymen    it isn t directed at all   said the white rabbit   in fact  there s nothing written on the outside   he unfolded the paper as he spoke  and added  it isn t a letter  after all  it s a set of verses     are they in the prisoner s handwriting   asked another of the jurymen    no  they re not   said the white rabbit   and that s the queerest thing about it    the jury all looked puzzled     he must have imitated somebody else s hand   said the king   the jury all brightened up again     please your majesty   said the knave   i didn t write it  and they can t prove i did  there s no name signed at the end     if you didn t sign it   said the king   that only makes the matter worse  you must have meant some mischief  or else you d have signed your name like an honest man    there was a general clapping of hands at this  it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day    that proves his guilt   said the queen    it proves nothing of the sort   said alice   why  you don t even know what they re about     read them   said the king   the white rabbit put on his spectacles   where shall i begin  please your majesty   he asked    begin at the beginning   the king said gravely   and go on till you come to the end  then stop    these were the verses the white rabbit read         they told me you had been to her      and mentioned me to him     she gave me a good character      but said i could not swim      he sent them word i had not gone      we know it to be true      if she should push the matter on      what would become of you      i gave her one  they gave him two      you gave us three or more     they all returned from him to you      though they were mine before      if i or she should chance to be     involved in this affair     he trusts to you to set them free      exactly as we were      my notion was that you had been      before she had this fit     an obstacle that came between     him  and ourselves  and it      don t let him know she liked them best      for this must ever be    a secret  kept from all the rest      between yourself and me     that s the most important piece of evidence we ve heard yet   said the king  rubbing his hands   so now let the jury      if any one of them can explain it   said alice   she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn t a bit afraid of interrupting him    i ll give him sixpence   i  don t believe there s an atom of meaning in it    the jury all wrote down on their slates   she doesn t believe there s an atom of meaning in it   but none of them attempted to explain the paper    if there s no meaning in it   said the king   that saves a world of trouble  you know  as we needn t try to find any  and yet i don t know   he went on  spreading out the verses on his knee  and looking at them with one eye   i seem to see some meaning in them  after all     said i could not swim    you can t swim  can you   he added  turning to the knave   the knave shook his head sadly   do i look like it   he said   which he certainly did not  being made entirely of cardboard     all right  so far   said the king  and he went on muttering over the verses to himself    we know it to be true    that s the jury  of course   i gave her one  they gave him two    why  that must be what he did with the tarts  you know      but  it goes on  they all returned from him to you    said alice    why  there they are   said the king triumphantly  pointing to the tarts on the table   nothing can be clearer than that  then again   before she had this fit    you never had fits  my dear  i think   he said to the queen    never   said the queen furiously  throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke   the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger  as he found it made no mark  but he now hastily began again  using the ink  that was trickling down his face  as long as it lasted     then the words don t fit you   said the king  looking round the court with a smile  there was a dead silence    it s a pun   the king added in an offended tone  and everybody laughed   let the jury consider their verdict   the king said  for about the twentieth time that day    no  no   said the queen   sentence first  verdict afterwards     stuff and nonsense   said alice loudly   the idea of having the sentence first     hold your tongue   said the queen  turning purple    i won t   said alice    off with her head   the queen shouted at the top of her voice  nobody moved    who cares for you   said alice   she had grown to her full size by this time    you re nothing but a pack of cards    at this the whole pack rose up into the air  and came flying down upon her  she gave a little scream  half of fright and half of anger  and tried to beat them off  and found herself lying on the bank  with her head in the lap of her sister  who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face    wake up  alice dear   said her sister   why  what a long sleep you ve had     oh  i ve had such a curious dream   said alice  and she told her sister  as well as she could remember them  all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about  and when she had finished  her sister kissed her  and said   it was a curious dream  dear  certainly  but now run in to your tea  it s getting late   so alice got up and ran off  thinking while she ran  as well she might  what a wonderful dream it had been   but her sister sat still just as she left her  leaning her head on her hand  watching the setting sun  and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures  till she too began dreaming after a fashion  and this was her dream     first  she dreamed of little alice herself  and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee  and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers  she could hear the very tones of her voice  and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes  and still as she listened  or seemed to listen  the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister s dream   the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by  the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool  she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their never ending meal  and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution  once more the pig baby was sneezing on the duchess s knee  while plates and dishes crashed around it  once more the shriek of the gryphon  the squeaking of the lizard s slate pencil  and the choking of the suppressed guinea pigs  filled the air  mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle   so she sat on  with closed eyes  and half believed herself in wonderland  though she knew she had but to open them again  and all would change to dull reality  the grass would be only rustling in the wind  and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds  the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep bells  and the queen s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy  and the sneeze of the baby  the shriek of the gryphon  and all the other queer noises  would change  she knew  to the confused clamour of the busy farm yard  while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtle s heavy sobs   lastly  she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would  in the after time  be herself a grown woman  and how she would keep  through all her riper years  the simple and loving heart of her childhood  and how she would gather about her other little children  and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale  perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago  and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows  and find a pleasure in all their simple joys  remembering her own child life  and the happy summer days                 the end      end
